            Whether it’s a trip to the vet, a playdate at a park, or just a ride
            across town, Uber Pet ensures your furry companions can accompany you
            hassle-free. Booking is easy—just enter your destination in the Uber
            app, select “Uber Pet,” review trip details, and confirm. The feature
            supports both on-demand and scheduled rides, catering to spontaneous
            plans and pre-booked errands. Uber has also collaborated with Heads Up
            For Tails (HUFT) to offer exclusive discounts when traveling to HUFT
            stores and spas in these cities. Presenting your Uber Pet ride receipt
            at the store unlocks added perks, making the experience even more
            delightful.

            a new feature—it's a step toward inclusive mobility where everyone,
            including our animal companions, is considered.

            A recent global survey by Mars Petcare highlights a significant shift
            in India's pet ownership landscape, with Gen Z leading the charge.
            The study reveals that 70% of Indian Gen Z pet owners are first-time
            pet parents, indicating a burgeoning trend of pet adoption among the
            youth.
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h4>
            This surge is attributed to the desire for companionship, emotional
            support, and the therapeutic benefits pets offer. The nuclearization
            of families and increased urbanization have further fueled this trend,
            as young individuals seek solace and connection through pet ownership.
            Cats, in particular, are gaining popularity for their low-maintenance
            nature and stress-relieving presence.
          </h4>
          <br />
          <h4>
            The pet care industry is responding to this shift by offering
            specialized services and products tailored to the needs of these new
            pet parents. From organic pet food to tech-enabled grooming solutions,
            the market is evolving to cater to the preferences of a younger,
            more informed demographic.

            The pet insurance market in India is projected to reach ₹6,500 crore
            by 2025, reflecting the growing awareness and need for financial
            protection among pet owners. This surge is driven by the increasing
            costs of veterinary care and a heightened sense of responsibility
            towards pet health.
